## Guidelines
1. Try to format code similarly to how it is now. This is to not mix-and-match coding styles and have a sloppy end-result.
2. Properly indent all code and don't over-complicate things. There will always be the possibility your requests will be accepted and then modified.
3. Test all your changes before pushing them.
4. Make sure the change is significant in size or functionality in some way.
5. Thoroughly document and explain any changes you've made.


If you are sure all these guidelines are met, please submit a Pull request with your changes.
